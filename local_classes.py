There are several classes built for Task Managers project.
These classes could be used as backend data collectors in further applications.
Classes:
    Day: interactive data structure, that stores tasks for any day.

    """
    This class is needed to store data about a specific day. 
    Day is a class object. The __init__ method accepts today's as a 'date'
    and the global prefix as a 'source'.
    This class performs the following methods:
    1. Creating new Tasks in different parts of the data strusture
    2. The ability to integrate data from one previous object into the current
    3. The ability to change the status of the Task
    4. Saving the data strusture of the weaving object to the directory
